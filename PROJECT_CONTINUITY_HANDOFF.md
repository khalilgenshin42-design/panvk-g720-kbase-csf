# PanVK G720 project continuity handoff
Last updated: 2026-11-03 (UTC)

This document is the durable handoff for future ChatGPT sessions working on this project. Read it before making changes. Treat GitHub history, branches, workflow artifacts, and the user's uploaded diagnostic archives as the source of truth. Do not assume this document contains every historical discussion; it records the key decisions, current state, and pointers needed to continue safely.

## User goal and hard constraints

- Target: Xiaomi 15T, MediaTek Dimensity 8400 Ultra / MT6899, Arm Mali-G720 MC7, Android 16, 12 GB RAM.
- User reports a 7-core G720 MC7 configuration. Query actual shader_present/core mask from the device; never hardcode seven compiler workers or queue counts.
- Build/test an experimental Mesa PanVK Android ARM64 driver for DXVK / VKD3D-Proton PC game emulation in Winlator Mali 1.2.
- User is non-rooted and has only an Android phone/Termux for local device-side work.
- **Never replace, patch, or install over the phone's stock/vendor Vulkan driver.** Keep experimental packages separate and use Winlator's custom driver importer only. Preserve System Driver as fallback.
- User authorizes autonomous repository read/write work. Ask for user action only when device testing or a missing fact genuinely requires it. Clearly distinguish static/compile validation from device runtime proof.
- Do not force-enable unsupported Vulkan features merely to satisfy DXVK. In particular, do not expose ray query or vertexPipelineStoresAndAtomics without a real implementation/correctness proof.

- All steps passed: dependencies, host tools, real Android ARM64 libdrm, Android-only configure, compile/stage, driver/manifest/dependency audit, flat ADPKG packaging, artifact upload.

Workflow artifact:
- Artifact ID: `13239804377`
- Name: `panvk-g720-android-only-experimental-package`
- Expires: 2027-02-01.
- Outer artifact downloaded in prior ChatGPT session as `/mnt/data/panvk-g720-android-only-experimental-package.zip`.
- The importable nested package was extracted as `/mnt/data/PanVK-G720-experimental.zip`.

Nested ADPKG contents (flat root):

- `SHA256SUMS`

Package metadata:
- name: PanVK Mali G720 (experimental)
- packageVersion: `26.3.0-devel-android-kbase-456cf76ab678`
- vendor: Mesa
- driverVersion: `26.3.0-devel`
- minApi: 30
- libraryName: `libvulkan_panfrost.so`
- explicit description says experimental, not Vulkan conformant, device/game compatibility unverified.

SHA256SUMS inside package:
- driver: `c8b492f0dd1da2726ea31dcb4810c2a534ea0666d51ec3813beaef573dd1979e`
- private libdrm: `55b2a44016d44f4ef3ce802d62b23b146e98ad915894a38b9fcaf096ee8e2b8c`

The package build script is `.github/scripts/package-panvk-adpkg.sh`; package docs are `packaging/README-WINLATOR.md`; workflow is `.github/workflows/android-only-experiment.yml`.
The package script patches only package copies: private libdrm SONAME becomes `libpanvk_drm.so`, driver's NEEDED entry is replaced, and RUNPATH is set to `$ORIGIN`. It verifies AArch64, NEEDED, SONAME, RUNPATH, and flat archive structure.

**What this proves:** Android ARM64 binary compiled/linked and package structure/linker metadata passed static checks. It does NOT prove Kbase ABI compatibility, correct cache/shareability behavior, Vulkan conformance, WSI stability, or game compatibility.

## Device test and current blocking fault (2026-11-03)

User imported the package into Winlator Mali 1.2 and tested Tomb Raider. It hangs at the loading screen. User uploaded:
`TombRaider_logs_2026-11-03_16-09-08.zip`
Contains:
- `wine_debug.log`
- `TombRaider_d3d11.log`
- `TombRaider_dxgi.log`
- `TombRaider_d3d9.log`

Relevant exact wine_debug.log lines:
```
[MESA-PANVK] kbase: CSF group 0 fatal error: status 0x00c00488 (exception 0x88), sideband 0x00000001ab1a047f
[error]: QueueSubmit failed: -4
../src/vulkan/wsi/wsi_common_x11.c:2027: Swapchain status changed to VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR
X connection to :0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).
```
DXVK D3D11 log ends with:
```
err: DxvkSubmissionQueue: Command submission failed: VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST
```

Log review established:
- PanVK loads.
- Vulkan device creation succeeds.
- DXVK initializes and creates a swapchain (900x506; actual properties later show FIFO, 4 images).
- Multiple Android Hardware Buffer/gralloc imports succeed before the fault.
- Kbase BO allocation and submission path are reached.
- Fatal GPU exception occurs, then queue submit reports -4, then DXVK reports VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST.
- Swapchain out-of-date and X connection teardown appear downstream after GPU failure, not established as root cause.
- DXVK compiler threads reported as four. Do not assume this is wrong; no evidence yet that thread count caused the fault.
- Do not ask user to reinstall or change arbitrary settings before source diagnosis.

### Exact meaning of status 0x00c00488

Arm Mali CSF UAPI register definitions identify exception byte `0x88` as `GPU_SHAREABILITY_FAULT`. See:
- https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/kernel/+/cf07462966736cdc97946fa2434e1d2f00d30b6c/drivers/gpu/arm/bifrost/include/uapi/mali_kbase_gpu_regmap_csf.h
- https://nest-open-source.googlesource.com/manifest_repos/mali-driver/+/0f8397eced2de6bc649a9cc32d0fae77a1dc34dc/bifrost/r44p0/kernel/drivers/gpu/arm/midgard/gpu/backend/mali_kbase_gpu_regmap_csf.h

A directly relevant community investigation:
- https://github.com/MineGraph-bilibili/panvk-Android/issues/3
- The reported 0x88 is shareability fault. In the sample status `0x04c00488`, bits [15:8] are access type `0x04`, an atomic. The user's exact status is `0x00c00488`; decode access type from its own [9:8] bits, not from another report. Note: `0x00c00488 >> 8 & 0x3 = 0`, which corresponds to atomic according to `GPU_FAULTSTATUS_ACCESS_TYPE_ATOMIC=0`. The issue argues that on non-I/O-coherent SoCs, GPU atomics with SYSTEM shareability across the GPU/IO boundary can fault, while CSG-scope atomics on uncached memory may be safe. This is a hypothesis to verify against our exact allocation/atomic paths, not yet a proven diagnosis for this device.
- Issue also describes intermittent failures linked to cache residency, and reports that a GPU reset kills the context.
- Related older discussion mentioned in that issue: mesa-funnymdzz issue #2. Search and inspect it before implementing a change.

**Important correction to prior assistant diagnosis:** do not treat this as a generic cache flush bug by default. A GPU_SHAREABILITY_FAULT is specifically a same-cache-line shareability attribute mismatch (shareable vs non-shareable access within GPU), or a relevant system/GPU shareability contract violation. Need decode the full status fields and trace the offending atomic's memory attributes/scope. A simple CPU cache flush is not necessarily the fix.

## High-priority source audit

Main source file:
`src/panfrost/lib/kmod/kbase_kmod.c`

Current relevant source facts from packaging branch:
- Kbase backend uses `/dev/mali0`.
- It parses raw GPU properties including `KBASE_GPUPROP_RAW_COHERENCY_MODE`.
- It currently sets `props->is_io_coherent = false` unconditionally.
- Comments explicitly say cached CPU mappings still need `KBASE_IOCTL_MEM_SYNC` before GPU access and after GPU writes.
- Supported BO flags include executable, alloc-on-fault, no-mmap, WB_MMAP, GPU_UNCACHED, CSF_EVENT.
- Cached BO synchronization is in `kbase_kmod_flush_bo_map_syncs()` around line ~2000, uses `KBASE_IOCTL_MEM_SYNC` with `BASE_SYNCSET_OP_MSYNC` / `BASE_SYNCSET_OP_CSYNC`.
- Env override `PANVK_KBASE_USER_CACHE_SYNC=0` forces kernel ioctl cache sync path; generic layer can otherwise issue architecture cache ops for WB_MMAP BOs. This optimization was documented as reducing ioctl overhead on G710, but must be checked against G720 and its IO-coherency mode.
- Kbase BO allocations without exclusive VM and without executable/alloc-on-fault/CSF-event flags may use Android dma-heap + dma-buf import path.
- Imported BO has separate GPU mapping and CPU dma-buf mapping.
- Kbase CSF group fatal error is latched and reported to queue status.

Generic source:
`src/panfrost/lib/kmod/pan_kmod.c` provides generic BO allocation/import/sync and backend dispatch. Inspect cache ops path and whether direct userspace cache ops are safe on Android AArch64 for this G720 + kernel driver configuration.

PanVK features:
`src/panfrost/vulkan/panvk_vX_physical_device.c`
- Extensions list currently does not advertise `VK_KHR_ray_query`.
- `vertexPipelineStoresAndAtomics` is gated:
```c
.vertexPipelineStoresAndAtomics =
   (PAN_ARCH >= 13 && instance->drirc.misc.enable_vertex_pipeline_stores_atomics) ||
   instance->drirc.misc.force_enable_shader_atomics,
```
- On Mali v12 this is disabled by default. Do not force-enable until compiler/hardware correctness is established.
- Kbase path disables sparse binding feature because sparse bind queue is a stub.
- Do not advertise ray query without implementation.

## Existing source work to preserve

- Shader core availability is derived from kernel-reported `shader_present`; no hardcoded MC7 worker count should be added.
- Descriptor variable-count arithmetic hardened with 64-bit intermediates and overflow guards (commit listed above).
- WAIT64 path uses GPU WAIT64 only for eligible local/internal binary payloads; imported sync_file, timeline wrappers, mixed waits, wait-only submit, oversized wait sets use CPU/KCPU fallback. Preserve max 3 wait cells and `GREATER(target - 1)` semantics.
- Kbase WSI path exists but requires runtime verification.
- Kbase BO memory mapping uses SAME_VA / EXEC_VA rules; do not add MAP_FIXED/hints against Kbase's restrictions.
- Previous work included 1 MiB CSF tiler chunks to avoid scarce 2 MiB contiguous allocations; preserve until a new analysis proves otherwise.

## Next steps for future sessions

1. Read this file, then inspect GitHub branch list and recent commits. Continue from `work/winlator-adpkg-packaging` for package code and from `work/android-libdrm-runtime-audit-latest` for previous audited baseline. Do not overwrite main or delete branches.
2. Inspect issue #3 and its linked mesa-funnymdzz issue #2; extract precise status bitfield decoding and proposed atomic scope / memory attribute remediation.
3. Inspect the exact `panvk_vX_queue.c`, `panvk_vX_sync.c`, shader atomic lowering, and `pan_kmod.c` cache synchronization path. Search for SYSTEM / DEVICE / CSG scope and GPU atomics on memory that can be DMA-BUF imported or non-IO-coherent.
4. Decode this exact status `0x00c00488` using upstream UAPI macros: exception type, access type, address-valid, JASID-valid, JASID, source ID. If address valid, expose/log fault address and source ID where safe. Sideband `0x00000001ab1a047f` may encode queue/CS metadata; use kernel ABI docs before interpreting.
5. Determine actual G720 coherency from `RAW_COHERENCY_MODE` (0=none, 1=ACE-Lite, 2=ACE) using device-side debug logging. Do not infer from SoC family.
6. Compare cache sync optimizations. If necessary, make a diagnostic build with `PANVK_KBASE_USER_CACHE_SYNC=0` set in Winlator environment only, if supported, to force KBASE_IOCTL_MEM_SYNC. This is a diagnostic A/B test, not a claimed fix. Do not change phone system driver.
7. Consider an isolated experiment branch for restricting SYSTEM-scope atomics to CSG scope only when memory is GPU-uncached/non-IO-coherent and semantics allow it. Do not broadly downgrade Vulkan memory-model atomics; scope/order must remain correct. Add targeted tests and document unsupported cases.
8. Rebuild, re-audit ADPKG, produce new checksum, then ask user to test only the specific diagnostic build.
9. Once GPU fault is addressed, separately diagnose WSI/X11 stability and game compatibility. Do not equate successful launch with performance superiority.

## Prior workload history

- Earlier Borderlands original GOTY (DX9, 1280x720) on Winlator Mali 1.2 System driver: around 20-29 FPS baseline; Wrapper V2 runs around 28-35 FPS. This is not a PanVK benchmark.
- Current PanVK test is Tomb Raider; it hangs at loading screen with the fault above.
- User wants the driver to outperform stock system driver in PC emulation, but first priority is correctness/stability.

## User interaction checkpoint

The user explicitly asked that all work remain accessible to future GPT sessions if the current conversation reaches its limit. This handoff document is intended to be the persistent entry point. In future sessions, user can say:
"Continue Project panvk drivef. Read PROJECT_CONTINUITY_HANDOFF.md in khalilgenshin42-design/panvk-g720-kbase-csf, then inspect the latest branches and continue from the recorded fault investigation."

Do not claim that every GPT version automatically shares live conversation memory. Durable GitHub docs/commits/artifacts are the reliable cross-session record. Update this file after every major milestone, including commit SHA, workflow run, artifact ID, checksum, test results, and next action.
