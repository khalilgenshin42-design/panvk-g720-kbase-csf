# PanVK G720 project continuity handoff
Last updated: 2026-11-03 (UTC)

This document is the durable handoff for future ChatGPT sessions working on this project. Read it before making changes. Treat GitHub history, branches, workflow artifacts, and the user's uploaded diagnostic archives as the source of truth. Do not assume this document contains every historical discussion; it records the key decisions, current state, and pointers needed to continue safely.

## User goal and hard constraints

- Target: Xiaomi 15T, MediaTek Dimensity 8400 Ultra / MT6899, Arm Mali-G720 MC7, Android 16, 12 GB RAM.
- User reports a 7-core G720 MC7 configuration. Query actual shader_present/core mask from the device; never hardcode seven compiler workers or queue counts.
- Build/test an experimental Mesa PanVK Android ARM64 driver for DXVK / VKD3D-Proton PC game emulation in Winlator Mali 1.2.
- User is non-rooted and has only an Android phone/Termux for local device-side work.
- **Never replace, patch, or install over the phone's stock/vendor Vulkan driver.** Keep experimental packages separate and use Winlator's custom driver importer only. Preserve System Driver as fallback.
- User authorizes autonomous repository read/write work. Ask for user action only when device testing or a missing fact genuinely requires it. Clearly distinguish static/compile validation from device runtime proof.
- Do not force-enable unsupported Vulkan features merely to satisfy DXVK. In particular, do not expose ray query or vertexPipelineStoresAndAtomics without a real implementation/correctness proof.

The package build script is `.github/scripts/package-panvk-adpkg.sh`; package docs are `packaging/README-WINLATOR.md`; workflow is `.github/workflows/android-only-experiment.yml`.
The package script patches only package copies: private libdrm SONAME becomes `libpanvk_drm.so`, driver's NEEDED entry is replaced, and RUNPATH is set to `$ORIGIN`. It verifies AArch64, NEEDED, SONAME, RUNPATH, and flat archive structure.

**What this proves:** Android ARM64 binary compiled/linked and package structure/linker metadata passed static checks. It does NOT prove Kbase ABI compatibility, correct cache/shareability behavior, Vulkan conformance, WSI stability, or game compatibility.

## Device test and current blocking fault (2026-11-03)

User imported the package into Winlator Mali 1.2 and tested Tomb Raider. It hangs at the loading screen. User uploaded:
`TombRaider_logs_2026-11-03_16-09-08.zip`
Contains:
- `wine_debug.log`
- `TombRaider_d3d11.log`
- `TombRaider_dxgi.log`
- `TombRaider_d3d9.log`

Relevant exact wine_debug.log lines:
```
[MESA-PANVK] kbase: CSF group 0 fatal error: status 0x00c00488 (exception 0x88), sideband 0x00000001ab1a047f
[error]: QueueSubmit failed: -4
../src/vulkan/wsi/wsi_common_x11.c:2027: Swapchain status changed to VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR
X connection to :0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).
```
DXVK D3D11 log ends with:
```
err: DxvkSubmissionQueue: Command submission failed: VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST
```

Log review established:
- PanVK loads.
- Vulkan device creation succeeds.
- DXVK initializes and creates a swapchain (900x506; actual properties later show FIFO, 4 images).
- Multiple Android Hardware Buffer/gralloc imports succeed before the fault.
- Kbase BO allocation and submission path are reached.
- Fatal GPU exception occurs, then queue submit reports -4, then DXVK reports VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST.
- Swapchain out-of-date and X connection teardown appear downstream after GPU failure, not established as root cause.
- DXVK compiler threads reported as four. Do not assume this is wrong; no evidence yet that thread count caused the fault.
- Do not ask user to reinstall or change arbitrary settings before source diagnosis.

### Exact meaning of status 0x00c00488

Arm Mali CSF UAPI register definitions identify exception byte `0x88` as `GPU_SHAREABILITY_FAULT`. See:
- https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/kernel/+/cf07462966736cdc97946fa2434e1d2f00d30b6c/drivers/gpu/arm/bifrost/include/uapi/mali_kbase_gpu_regmap_csf.h
- https://nest-open-source.googlesource.com/manifest_repos/mali-driver/+/0f8397eced2de6bc649a9cc32d0fae77a1dc34dc/bifrost/r44p0/kernel/drivers/gpu/arm/midgard/gpu/backend/mali_kbase_gpu_regmap_csf.h

A directly relevant community investigation:
- https://github.com/MineGraph-bilibili/panvk-Android/issues/3
- The reported 0x88 is shareability fault. In the sample status `0x04c00488`, bits [15:8] are access type `0x04`, an atomic. The user's exact status is `0x00c00488`; decode access type from its own [9:8] bits, not from another report. Note: `0x00c00488 >> 8 & 0x3 = 0`, which corresponds to atomic according to `GPU_FAULTSTATUS_ACCESS_TYPE_ATOMIC=0`. The issue argues that on non-I/O-coherent SoCs, GPU atomics with SYSTEM shareability across the GPU/IO boundary can fault, while CSG-scope atomics on uncached memory may be safe. This is a hypothesis to verify against our exact allocation/atomic paths, not yet a proven diagnosis for this device.
- Issue also describes intermittent failures linked to cache residency, and reports that a GPU reset kills the context.
- Related older discussion mentioned in that issue: mesa-funnymdzz issue #2. Search and inspect it before implementing a change.

**Important correction to prior assistant diagnosis:** do not treat this as a generic cache flush bug by default. A GPU_SHAREABILITY_FAULT is specifically a same-cache-line shareability attribute mismatch (shareable vs non-shareable access within GPU), or a relevant system/GPU shareability contract violation. Need decode the full status fields and trace the offending atomic's memory attributes/scope. A simple CPU cache flush is not necessarily the fix.

## High-priority source audit

Main source file:
`src/panfrost/lib/kmod/kbase_kmod.c`

Current relevant source facts from packaging branch:
- Kbase backend uses `/dev/mali0`.
- It parses raw GPU properties including `KBASE_GPUPROP_RAW_COHERENCY_MODE`.
- It currently sets `props->is_io_coherent = false` unconditionally.
- Comments explicitly say cached CPU mappings still need `KBASE_IOCTL_MEM_SYNC` before GPU access and after GPU writes.
- Supported BO flags include executable, alloc-on-fault, no-mmap, WB_MMAP, GPU_UNCACHED, CSF_EVENT.
- Cached BO synchronization is in `kbase_kmod_flush_bo_map_syncs()` around line ~2000, uses `KBASE_IOCTL_MEM_SYNC` with `BASE_SYNCSET_OP_MSYNC` / `BASE_SYNCSET_OP_CSYNC`.
- Env override `PANVK_KBASE_USER_CACHE_SYNC=0` forces kernel ioctl cache sync path; generic layer can otherwise issue architecture cache ops for WB_MMAP BOs. This optimization was documented as reducing ioctl overhead on G710, but must be checked against G720 and its IO-coherency mode.
- Kbase BO allocations without exclusive VM and without executable/alloc-on-fault/CSF-event flags may use Android dma-heap + dma-buf import path.
- Imported BO has separate GPU mapping and CPU dma-buf mapping.
- Kbase CSF group fatal error is latched and reported to queue status.

Generic source:
`src/panfrost/lib/kmod/pan_kmod.c` provides generic BO allocation/import/sync and backend dispatch. Inspect cache ops path and whether direct userspace cache ops are safe on Android AArch64 for this G720 + kernel driver configuration.

PanVK features:
`src/panfrost/vulkan/panvk_vX_physical_device.c`
- Extensions list currently does not advertise `VK_KHR_ray_query`.
- `vertexPipelineStoresAndAtomics` is gated:
```c
.vertexPipelineStoresAndAtomics =
   (PAN_ARCH >= 13 && instance->drirc.misc.enable_vertex_pipeline_stores_atomics) ||
   instance->drirc.misc.force_enable_shader_atomics,
```
- On Mali v12 this is disabled by default. Do not force-enable until compiler/hardware correctness is established.
- Kbase path disables sparse binding feature because sparse bind queue is a stub.
- Do not advertise ray query without implementation.

## Existing source work to preserve

- Shader core availability is derived from kernel-reported `shader_present`; no hardcoded MC7 worker count should be added.
- Descriptor variable-count arithmetic hardened with 64-bit intermediates and overflow guards (commit listed above).
- WAIT64 path uses GPU WAIT64 only for eligible local/internal binary payloads; imported sync_file, timeline wrappers, mixed waits, wait-only submit, oversized wait sets use CPU/KCPU fallback. Preserve max 3 wait cells and `GREATER(target - 1)` semantics.
- Kbase WSI path exists but requires runtime verification.
- Kbase BO memory mapping uses SAME_VA / EXEC_VA rules; do not add MAP_FIXED/hints against Kbase's restrictions.
- Previous work included 1 MiB CSF tiler chunks to avoid scarce 2 MiB contiguous allocations; preserve until a new analysis proves otherwise.

## Next steps for future sessions

1. Read this file, then inspect GitHub branch list and recent commits. Continue from `work/winlator-adpkg-packaging` for package code and from `work/android-libdrm-runtime-audit-latest` for previous audited baseline. Do not overwrite main or delete branches.
2. Inspect issue #3 and its linked mesa-funnymdzz issue #2; extract precise status bitfield decoding and proposed atomic scope / memory attribute remediation.
3. Inspect the exact `panvk_vX_queue.c`, `panvk_vX_sync.c`, shader atomic lowering, and `pan_kmod.c` cache synchronization path. Search for SYSTEM / DEVICE / CSG scope and GPU atomics on memory that can be DMA-BUF imported or non-IO-coherent.
4. Decode this exact status `0x00c00488` using upstream UAPI macros: exception type, access type, address-valid, JASID-valid, JASID, source ID. If address valid, expose/log fault address and source ID where safe. Sideband `0x00000001ab1a047f` may encode queue/CS metadata; use kernel ABI docs before interpreting.
5. Determine actual G720 coherency from `RAW_COHERENCY_MODE` (0=none, 1=ACE-Lite, 2=ACE) using device-side debug logging. Do not infer from SoC family.
6. Compare cache sync optimizations. If necessary, make a diagnostic build with `PANVK_KBASE_USER_CACHE_SYNC=0` set in Winlator environment only, if supported, to force KBASE_IOCTL_MEM_SYNC. This is a diagnostic A/B test, not a claimed fix. Do not change phone system driver.
7. Consider an isolated experiment branch for restricting SYSTEM-scope atomics to CSG scope only when memory is GPU-uncached/non-IO-coherent and semantics allow it. Do not broadly downgrade Vulkan memory-model atomics; scope/order must remain correct. Add targeted tests and document unsupported cases.
8. Rebuild, re-audit ADPKG, produce new checksum, then ask user to test only the specific diagnostic build.
9. Once GPU fault is addressed, separately diagnose WSI/X11 stability and game compatibility. Do not equate successful launch with performance superiority.

## Prior workload history

- Earlier Borderlands original GOTY (DX9, 1280x720) on Winlator Mali 1.2 System driver: around 20-29 FPS baseline; Wrapper V2 runs around 28-35 FPS. This is not a PanVK benchmark.
- Current PanVK test is Tomb Raider; it hangs at loading screen with the fault above.
- User wants the driver to outperform stock system driver in PC emulation, but first priority is correctness/stability.

## User interaction checkpoint

The user explicitly asked that all work remain accessible to future GPT sessions if the current conversation reaches its limit. This handoff document is intended to be the persistent entry point. In future sessions, user can say:
"Continue Project panvk drivef. Read PROJECT_CONTINUITY_HANDOFF.md in khalilgenshin42-design/panvk-g720-kbase-csf, then inspect the latest branches and continue from the recorded fault investigation."

Do not claim that every GPT version automatically shares live conversation memory. Durable GitHub docs/commits/artifacts are the reliable cross-session record. Update this file after every major milestone, including commit SHA, workflow run, artifact ID, checksum, test results, and next action.


## Addendum: confirmed WAIT64 scope defect and diagnostic patch (2026-11-03 15:17 UTC)

A decisive source comparison has identified a highly plausible cause of the user's exact 0x88 fault.

- Upstream community investigation: https://github.com/MineGraph-bilibili/panvk-Android/issues/3
- The issue describes a non-I/O-coherent Mali G715 (MT6985) with the same `GPU_SHAREABILITY_FAULT 0x88`.
- Their command-stream census isolated `SYNC_WAIT64` emitted with default `System` scope. Their GenXML had no Scope field for `SYNC_WAIT32/64`, unlike `SYNC_ADD64`. Their patch added Scope at bits start=1 size=2, passed CSG scope into wait emission, and changed the encoded wait atom from `0x...0000` to `0x...0004`. They still observed 0x88 afterward, so it was a real defect but not a complete root-cause fix.
- The issue found a later remaining possibility in firmware/microcode: the SYNC_WAIT operation's internal atomic read may ignore the scope field. Their proposed decisive workaround is replacing SYNC_WAIT with load + conditional branch loop.

Our exact packaging source branch was checked:
- `src/panfrost/genxml/v10.xml`, `v12.xml`, `v13.xml`, `v14.xml`: `CS SYNC_WAIT32` and `CS SYNC_WAIT64` structs had Error Reject / Condition / Data / Address / Opcode but no Scope field. `SYNC_ADD32/64` and `SYNC_SET32/64` did have Scope.
- `src/panfrost/genxml/cs_builder.h`: `cs_sync32_wait` / `cs_sync64_wait` macro had no scope parameter and did not set `I.scope`.
- `src/panfrost/vulkan/csf/panvk_vX_gpu_queue.c`: GPU WAIT64 path emits `cs_sync64_wait(... GREATER ...)` for eligible local waits. The same file has a diagnostic option `PANVK_KBASE_SYNC_ADD64_CSG_SCOPE`, default false, for ADD64 scope.
- This directly intersects the user's successful DXVK initialization followed by CSF GPU fault.

Diagnostic experiment branch created:
`experiment/csf-sync-wait64-csg-scope`

Changes made:
1. Added `Scope` (2 bits, start=1, enum CS Sync Scope) to both SYNC_WAIT32 and SYNC_WAIT64 structures in v10/v12/v13/v14 GenXML.
2. Added `enum mali_cs_sync_scope scope` parameter to generated `cs_sync*_wait` builder macro and writes `I.scope = scope`.
3. Changed the only currently found PanVK CSF WAIT64 emission site to pass `MALI_CS_SYNC_SCOPE_CSG`, with an explanatory comment.
4. Added this branch to Android-only CI workflow push filters.

CI runs triggered by per-file commits; the latest full-change run is:
- Run ID `41662126467` (also a duplicate run `41662126541` on same SHA)
- URL: https://github.com/khalilgenshin42-design/panvk-g720-kbase-csf/actions/runs/41662126467
- SHA: `9eae560bafeb85b1faa1da841a00881a677acd19`
Check this run to establish whether generated GenXML/build succeeds. Earlier intermediate runs were triggered before all changes landed and are not the final validation.

Decode user's exact status `0x00c00488` using upstream UAPI bit definitions:
- exception type bits [7:0] = 0x88 = GPU_SHAREABILITY_FAULT.
- access type bits [9:8] = 0 = ATOMIC.
- address-valid bit [10] = 1.
- JASID-valid bit [11] = 0.
- JASID bits [15:12] = 0 (invalid per valid bit).
- source ID bits [31:16] = 0x00c0.
This is stronger evidence for an atomic shareability fault. The earlier community issue's prose loosely described [15:8] as atomic; use the actual UAPI macros ([9:8]) for decoding.

Do not declare this patch a fix until it builds and user tests it. Even if it suppresses this specific WAIT64 fault, the upstream investigation explicitly observed 0x88 continuing after adding the scope field, so follow with diagnostics and, if needed, a LOAD+conditional-branch wait workaround. Preserve CPU/KCPU fallbacks for ineligible waits. Do not globally alter all atomics or cache sync behavior.

## Addendum 2: cross-CSG scope mismatch found in our own source (2026-11-03)

Important correction to the first WAIT64 experiment:
- The WAIT64 scope field itself is a valid missing-encoding fix, but changing the kbase wrapper's WAIT64 scope to CSG was not justified for its waits. Existing source comment at `panvk_vX_gpu_queue.c:536-540` explicitly says the internal PanVK binary waits can target completion counters produced by *distinct CSGs*, and an earlier G720 experiment physically proved SYSTEM-scope WAIT64 `GREATER(target-1)` works across distinct CSGs.
- The diagnostic branch has therefore been corrected to emit WAIT64 with explicit `MALI_CS_SYNC_SCOPE_SYSTEM`. This preserves the old zero scope bits while making the scope visible in the builder API. Do not revert to CSG scope for these cross-CSG waits.

A more directly actionable mismatch was found:
- `kbase_create_group()` in `panvk_vX_gpu_queue.c` calls `kbase_kmod_csf_group_create(..., 1, ...)` separately for each PanVK subqueue. The queue header documents that each PanVK subqueue owns its own CSG.
- Kbase's command-buffer creation sets `cmdbuf->sync_scope = MALI_CS_SYNC_SCOPE_SYSTEM` (see `panvk_vX_cmd_buffer.c:903-909`) specifically for Kbase.
- However, `cs_render_desc_ringbuf_reserve()` in `panvk_vX_cmd_draw.c` had hard-coded `MALI_CS_SYNC_SCOPE_CSG` for the reservation/decrement of the render descriptor ring syncobj. The matching release operation in the fragment path uses `cmdbuf->sync_scope`, which is SYSTEM on Kbase.
- This means the shared render descriptor ring syncobj could be updated from separate CSGs with inconsistent shareability scopes: reservation CSG, release SYSTEM. This matches the class of cross-subqueue scope mismatch described in https://www.reddit.com/r/EmulationMediatekMali/comments/1wtx1su/does_anyone_know_whats_going_on/ and is a much stronger concrete candidate than globally changing WAIT64 scope.

The experiment branch now includes a targeted correction:
- `cs_render_desc_ringbuf_reserve()` takes an explicit `enum mali_cs_sync_scope scope`.
- Its SYNC_ADD32 uses that scope.
- The callsite passes `cmdbuf->sync_scope`, making the reserve and release operations use SYSTEM on Kbase and CSG on Panthor.
- WAIT64 is explicitly SYSTEM for cross-CSG waits.
- The GenXML WAIT scope field and builder API additions remain, allowing precise future control and diagnostics.

Latest branch commits:
- `7c68aba20defa743250aaaac4ed5cce442d59d7a`: restore SYSTEM scope for cross-CSG WAIT64.
- `827240a83442cf39db021f771fe97c4e931d5ff3`: match descriptor-ring reserve scope to the matching release operation.

Next: wait for CI on the latest branch head, then review *all* cross-subqueue syncobj producers/consumers for scope symmetry. Only after build success should the user test this targeted candidate. The earlier run on SHA `9eae560bafeb85b1faa1da841a00881a677acd19` is an intermediate build and does not validate the latest two commits.


## 2026-11-03 addendum — WAIT scope call-site audit and build retry

- The previous CI runs on `34280b58d746dddaf4c33a33d238e6d50826b4e2` had not yet reached a final status at the time of recheck.
- A full CSF source scan found additional old-signature WAIT call sites after adding the scope argument to the low-level builder:
  - `src/panfrost/vulkan/csf/panvk_vX_cmd_draw.c`: descriptor ring-buffer `cs_sync32_wait` now receives the ring's selected scope; vertex-to-fragment tiler `panvk_instr_sync64_wait` now receives `cmdbuf->sync_scope`.
  - `src/panfrost/vulkan/csf/panvk_vX_cmd_event.c`: event `panvk_instr_sync32_wait` now receives `cmdbuf->sync_scope`.
- These are follow-up compile/API integration fixes, not proven runtime synchronization fixes.
- Commits on `experiment/csf-sync-wait64-csg-scope`:
  - `34280b58d746dddaf4c33a33d238e6d50826b4e2`: thread scope through instruction wrapper and barrier wait.
  - `68034c7c705221e81d243af8c7e8164cce92ef92`: pass scope to descriptor-ring and tiler waits.
  - `6634282aa14616931656b883aafb5519831eb888`: pass scope to event waits; this is current branch HEAD unless later commits supersede it.
- CI triggered for the intermediate SHA `68034c7c705221e81d243af8c7e8164cce92ef92`:
  - Android-only run `41665460748`.
  - Android wrapper run `41665460790`.
  - Both were in progress at the time of this addendum. Re-query before treating as pass/fail.
- Audit all remaining direct `cs_sync32_wait`, `cs_sync64_wait`, `panvk_instr_sync32_wait`, and `panvk_instr_sync64_wait` call sites whenever the builder signature changes. Ensure no legacy signature remains in CSF source.
- No package has been produced from these follow-up commits yet; do not ask the user to test until CI passes and package contents/checksums are verified.

  - Inner package SHA256: `c765155efad594dcacc5ff62bc2e532856dddc36bc4a9303d4d2e4e7d5b849eb`
  - Inner package files: `meta.json`, `libvulkan_panfrost.so`, `libpanvk_drm.so`, `SHA256SUMS`.
  - SHA256SUMS verified OK for all three payload files.
  - Driver and private libdrm are ELF64 little-endian AArch64 Android shared objects; driver SONAME `libvulkan_panfrost.so`, NEEDED uses private `libpanvk_drm.so`, RUNPATH `$ORIGIN`; private libdrm is packaged alongside. Outer stage also includes runtime stub and supporting audit records.
  - Metadata explicitly states experimental, not Vulkan conformant, compatibility unverified; min API 30; Mesa 26.3.0-devel.
- This proves compile, link, packaging, and static package integrity only. It does NOT prove runtime correctness or fix the previously observed CSF `GPU_SHAREABILITY_FAULT 0x88`.
- Next step: user may import this exact package into Winlator's custom driver manager as an isolated test driver, retaining System Driver as fallback. Test the same Tomb Raider workload and collect fresh logs. Do not install or replace Android's system/vendor driver. If the app's importer expects the outer artifact, extract `PanVK-G720-experimental.zip` from it and import that inner ZIP.
